# Typing SpeedRunners

Typing SpeedRunners is a web application designed to measure your typing speed. The website fetches random quotes from an API and presents them in a textbox for users to type. Users can then see their words per minute (WPM), characters per minute (CPM), total characters typed, and their highest score within a set amount of time. The highest score is stored in the browser's local storage (cookies) for future reference.
